I'd like to start with Unity. Can you explain how to handle user input in Unity, such as mouse or keyboard events?", "So, you've used Unity's built-in listeners for input.

How do you configure the Input Manager in Unity to detect keyboard and mouse events, without relying on Unity's built-in features?"], "responses": [" You are even listeners on the mouse and on the keyboard.", " I use package for input."], "mp3_paths": ["responses/f5b46deb-0145-4dd9-b85e-d52806f8971f.mp3", "responses/41ce775d-d357-416f-9f48-e734a5efc565.mp3", "responses/65c2a471-1690-46ab-9db4-6aa871251084.mp3", "responses/7b5341f9-e3a3-45c6-acab-53a08a6dae85.mp3"], "ai_summary": "Summary:\n\nThe interview started with an introduction to Hubert, a gamedev software developer intern, and his claimed skills.
